# Kanji Definiton:
# Strips a source Japanese word of English & Kana characters, and returns definitions of the Kanji leftover.

# I wanted to use this in Anki as an addon with predefined Source and Destination fields 
# eg as follows: 
# kanji_source = [Kanji word]
# Dest1 = ['Kanji info 1']
# Dest2 = ['Kanji info 2']
# Dest3 = ['Kanji info 3']
# Dest4 = ['Kanji info 4']
